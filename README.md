The study of changes in seismicity, and the potential of the occurrences of large earthquakes in a seismic zone is not only very important from the aspect of seismological research, but it is also significant in the decisions of crisis management. since, nowadays Machine learning techniques have proven high ability for analyzing information, and discovering the relations among the parameters, in this research were tested some of these techniques with the aim of earthquake prediction. For analysis, the north Zagros seismic catalogue was selected. A region that is an active seismic zone and large cities are located there. Moreover, nine seismic parameters were used to study the possibility of large earthquake prediction for 1 month using three different Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). The accuracy of prediction models was evaluated using four different statistical measures (recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score). The results showed that the (ANN) method is more accurate than other methods. Regarding the completeness of the seismic catalogue in large magnitude, better accuracy results have been obtained to predict the earthquakes with larger scale earthquakes based on three studied methods. These achievements promise the possibility of successful prediction in a short period, which is hopeful for better crisis management performance.


This code has been developed for applying three Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM))  to earthquake prediction. The code reports the sensitivity of the results.
